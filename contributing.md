# How to Contribute

Thank you for considering contributing to our collaborative learning environment!

We welcome any suggestions or improvements that can enhance the learning experience for all cohort members.

## Pull Requests

We use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) as our main versioning workflow. All pull requests should follow the Conventional Commits specification.

1. **Fork the Repository:**

   - Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Branch:**

   - For each feature, fix, or improvement, create a new branch. For example:

     ```bash
     git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
     ```

3. **Work on Your Changes:**

   - Make your changes in the newly created branch.

4. **Send a Pull Request:**

   - Open a pull request from your feature branch to the **main** branch.

**Important:**

- Separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches.
- Send a pull request for each branch. This allows us to review and merge new features or improvements individually.

## Style Guide

All pull requests SHOULD adhere to the [Conventional Commits specification](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
